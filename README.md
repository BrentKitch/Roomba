# Roomba

## Overview
In class project that simulates an automated vaccum cleaner. Kept basic without the use of arrays or additional classes/objects. Run output to a file. Use a graphing program to view the Roomba's journey across the room.  

## Current Version Version 1.1
### Bounce Angles
Roomba currently bounces off at the same angle it came into the collision. Code is messy and not cleaned up through debugging comments and actions. Hard coded angle and starting location to prove concept. of bounce angles. 
#### Bugs
Gets stuck in the bottom part of the couch.


## Version 1
### Minimum Viable Project
Roomba traveled along the room at random angles. Took the number of max iterations from user. Random starting location and angle.
